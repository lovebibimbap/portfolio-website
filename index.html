                    This website is part of my work for <em>ENGCMP 0610: Composing Digital Media</em>. 
                    In this course, we learned how to create and edit digital media projects using tools like 
                    Audacity for audio editing and Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing. 
                    Each tool was used to complete a major project — an audio narrative and a video essay — 
                    both of which are showcased here in my portfolio.

                    Making this website helped me understand how to put together and share digital media projects. 
                    I learned how to organize information across different pages, link everything together, and keep the design consistent. 
                    Working with HTML and CSS showed me how important it is to have both good content and a clean layout so that everything is easy for the viewer to read and navigate.

                    One thing I found a little hard was figuring out how to keep the website simple but not boring. 
                    I wanted it to look neat without adding too much. 
                    As I worked through the CSS, I learned how to add color, spacing, and basic layout without making the page too busy. 
                    It felt really good to see the website come together step by step.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Composing for this course overall taught me that design is just as important as content. 
                    Whether it was editing audio, making a video, or building this website, 
                    I realized that how you present your work changes how people experience it. 
                    Even small choices, like what colors you use or how you organize sections, make a difference.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    This course also made me feel more comfortable using digital tools to tell stories and share projects. 
                    I’m proud of the audio, video, and website work I finished. 
                    Now I feel more ready to use these skills for school projects, work, or anything else in the future.
