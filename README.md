# Portfolio-Website
This website is part of my work for ENGCMP 0610: Composing Digital Media. In this course, we learned how to create and edit digital media projects using tools like Audacity for audio editing and Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing. Each tool was used to complete a major project — an audio narrative and a video essay — both of which are showcased here in my portfolio.
