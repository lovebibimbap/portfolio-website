                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    My narrative tells the incredible story of Leicester City’s 2015–16 Premier League triumph, where a team given 5000–1 odds pulled off one of the greatest underdog victories in sports history.
                    Initially, I considered focusing on a single dramatic comeback match, but after feedback from my peers, I realized that Leicester’s entire season was a much richer and more powerful story.
                    This wasn’t just about football — it was about resilience, teamwork, and proving that the impossible can happen. I wanted to make sure this episode wasn’t just for football fans
                    but for anyone who loves an inspiring story of defying the odds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To fully bring this story to life, I used sound and music to create an immersive experience. High-energy background music keeps the momentum going, while stadium crowd noise at the start
                    immediately sets the scene. I also included real match commentary clips to make key moments feel as exciting as they were when they happened.
                    Instead of just telling the story, I wanted listeners to feel like they were reliving it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feedback from my classmates played a big role in shaping this project. They suggested keeping the BGM consistent throughout to maintain excitement, which really helped improve the pacing.
                    In fact, even choosing Leicester City as my subject was influenced by their insights — it made me realize that an underdog story spread over a whole season is far more compelling than
                    just one game. Working with Audacity was also a learning experience, especially layering sound effects, narration, and commentary to make everything flow smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than just a sports podcast, this episode is about the power of belief, perseverance, and teamwork. Whether you’re a football fan or not, Leicester’s story is proof that sometimes,
                    just sometimes, the impossible becomes reality.
